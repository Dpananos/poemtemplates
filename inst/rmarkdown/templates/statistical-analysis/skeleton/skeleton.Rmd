## Introduction

This is a section where we would describe what we're doing and why.

## Data Cleaning

This is a section where we would write down if we have to clean the data in a specific way.  We might write

* Why we excluded some patients
* If we standardized the variables
* What are the reference cases
* etc.

## Analysis 

This is a section where we would describe what we do and why.  We can include code here too

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)

plot(fit, which=1)

```


## Conclusions

What did we learn?
